The goal of this project is to develop a structured front end coding environment. 

<ol>
	<li>Be scalable enough for any type of frameworks</li>
	<li>Develop CSS with SASS</li>
	<li>Develop JavaScript with Typescript</li>
	<li>Use Gulp to automatically compile/transpile SASS .scss files into .css files and Typescript's .ts files into .js files</li>
	<li>Use Gulp to copy files to directores for various environments</li>
	<li>Use Gulp to optimize files by combining and/or minimizing files</li>
</ol>

This is still a work in progress. The gulpfile.js needs to be cleaned up.

Currently I am using AngularJS 2 framework as a way to test the application.
